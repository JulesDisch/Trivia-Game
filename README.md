# Trivia-Game
The one where there's trivia. . .
Here we have a Yankees trivia game, using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. 
You'll see that while there is no user input required to advance after picking a correct or incorrect answer, there is a modal for the timeout. 
The modal will "stop the clock" as it were, for that question. It will not keep moving them through the game. 
If the user clicks "Keep playing", they will see the correct answer, and then the game continues.
If they click "Stop playing", they will see the start screen.
Once the user answers (or timesout) all ten questions, they see a modal for "Game over".
When they click "OK", the "x", or outside the modal, they see their final tally of correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions.
If they click "Play again?", the game resets, with the trivia questions shuffled into a different order.
