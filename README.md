# Trivia-Game
the one where there's trivia
ok. so here we have a yankees trivia game. please don't fail me for that. i can't help how i was raised. 
I tried to do the harder option. 
There are, perhaps, a few deviations:
You'll see that while there is no user input required to advance after picking a correct or incorrect answer, there is an alert for the timeout. i liked this, in case someone accidentally was looking away from the game, the alert would "stop the clock" as it were, for that question. it would not keep moving them through the game. once they click "ok", they will see the "time's up!" screen, with the correct answer, and then the game continues.
there is also an alert for "game over!" before updating the page with the final score. I also liked this because I felt there should be some "louder" indication than merely the text on the page updating, especially because my game tracks the user's correct, incorrect, and unanswered scores throughout the game.
fun bonus thing: my ten questions will generate in a different order each time you play the game. say whaaaa?!
